# DL_COVID19-COSWARA

To run the model, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

* Python 3.6 or later
* torch: Deep learning library to create the CNN-LSTM model.
* pandas: For CSV file manipulation.
* scikit-learn: For data scaling and splitting.
* torchmetrics: For evaluating the model with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
* matplotlib : For plotting 

# Run Model
1. Navigate to LSTM.ipynb and open it.
2. The data('normalised_features_with_diagnosis.csv') should be in the same folder as the notebook
3. The trained model parameters will be saved in a file named best_model.pth. This file is necessary for running the model evaluation and should be located in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.
4. The trained model parameters will be saved in a file named best_model.pth. This file is necessary for running the model evaluation and should be located in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook.
